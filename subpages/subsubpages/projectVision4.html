      <h6>Short Description:</h6>
      <p>
        Dago-AInspector is an AI-powered system that simply automates the
        humanly impossible task of identifying defective products from assembly
        lines in real-time to ensure consistent product quality and be able to
        make informed decisions and act upon existing manufacturing issues.

      <h6>Description:</h6>
      <p>
        HackaTUM is an online hackaton by Technische Universität München (TUM).
        In a case challenge by Accenture, the teams need to build a computer
        vision system using Azure cloud services (Azure Functions, Azure
        Computer Vision, Azure Cloud Database, and Azure Database). The
        processed result needs to be visualized in PowerBI to see the full
        pipeline. Our team provides the best solution in using Azure Cloud
        Services to build Computer Vision solutions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h6>Responsibilities:</h6>
      <p>
        <li>
          Develop the azure cloud solution for object detection and databases.
        </li>
        <li>Present the result in the annual hackaton by TUM</li>
      </p>

      <h6>Inspiration:</h6>
      <p>
        The large scale of mass manufacturing has its challenges when it comes
        to ensuring consistent quality in every product. One of them is the lack
        of providing real-time information on product quality. An efficient and
        effective way of conducting quality assurance within the mass
        manufacturing pipeline should be developed to provide transparency to
        the users on cost impact resulting from waste, delays, losses, etc. Our
        AI-powered system will hopefully create an easy-to-use system that can
        quickly determine product defects and their remedies in a highly dynamic
        manufacturing environment to ensure a smooth mass manufacturing process
        and happy customers.

      <h6>What it does:</h6>
      <p>
        We simply automate the humanly impossible task to identify defective
        products from assembly lines in real-time to ensure consistent product
        quality and be able to make informed decisions and act upon existing
        manufacturing issues.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h6>How we built it:</h6>
      <p>
        We orchestrated azure components in order to create the best image
        classifier to detect defects and visualize the relevant data in Power
        BI.
